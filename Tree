Tree is one of the hard parts in Algoritim.
I won't introduce the concepts of Tree one by one, those mostly repeat in Discrete mathematics. So, there just list some of Binary tree.
Since I'm a Chinese, I study with the profile with Chinse for the most part. I will try my best to describe these concpt with my understanding in English.
